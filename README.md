# Water and urban forms
The repository contains five separate tables with the analysis of the links between Water and urban forms. The tables are:
- Cities DB
- Pixels DB
- Water DB
- Aridity and rainfall by cities
- Aridity and rainfall by subregion

The variable ID links the three separate tables. 

## Cities DB
The table contains the structure for 105 cities in Asia, Africa and Latin America, including variables related to its critical infrastructure, access to water, remoteness, sparseness and water tariffs.

## Pixels DB
The table contains nearly 20,000 observations corresponding to different pixels within a city. All pixels are based on the Relative Wealth Index pixels. They contain variables related to rain and critical infrastructure.

## Water DB
The table contains nearly 125,000 survey respondents from the DHS survey. Each observation corresponds to one survey respondent and answers whether the person has access to water and sewage.

## Aridity and rainfall by cities
Considers the yearly rainfall for approximately 11,000 cities worldwide and the soil capacity to retain water.

## Aridity and rainfall by subregion
Considers the yearly rainfall for approximately 11,000 cities worldwide and the soil capacity to retain water. Values are averaged by city, weighted by population.
